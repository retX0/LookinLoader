# LookinLoader, a Tweak for LookinSever

LookinLoader lets you choose specific applications where you want to observe the view hierarchy via LookinServer.
It uses the AltList library for app selection within the Settings pane (loaded by PreferenceLoader), replacing the older AppList.
Download the correct `.deb` package from the [Action page](https://github.com/retX0/LookinLoader/actions): install the rootful version for rootful jailbreaks, or the rootless version for rootless jailbreaks.
For further information about Lookin itself, please visit the official website: http://lookin.work.
